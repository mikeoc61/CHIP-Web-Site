I set up a CHIP SBC to act as a Web Camera host using motion and motioneye.

In this repository:

- index.html belongs in /var/www/html (assuming apache2)

- motion_guide.html belongs in /var/www/html

- stats.sh belongs in /usr/lib/cgi-bin

- pwrstat executable belongs in /usr/lib/cgi-bin

Project inspired by the following post on the getchip.com forums:

- https://bbs.nextthing.co/t/build-a-full-featured-security-cam-for-cheap/12573

The following resource was also extremely helpful:
