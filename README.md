# CHIP Webcam Project

I set up a [CHIP](http://getchip.com/) SBC to act as a Web Camera host using motion and motioneye.

## In this repository:

* index.html belongs in /var/www/html (assuming apache2)

* stats.sh belongs in /usr/lib/cgi-bin

* pwrstat executable belongs in /usr/lib/cgi-bin

* toggle.sh and toggle_light.py both go into /usr/lib/cgi-bin

## Project inspired by the following post on the getchip.com forums:
